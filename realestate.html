							</p>This has been a project that, in its humble beginnings was an excuse to boost my data management skills and has since gradually transformed into an (almost) end-to-end product. The motivation to create this spawned from the arduous navigation required to view real estate data online, not to mention the time spent doing it. What if I wanted to quickly pull-up a suburb, see not only the long-term historical performance, but also the value of recently sold properties?<p>
								<p>To paint a picture, imagine walking through a neighborhood and noticing a property for sale. Maybe you’re looking at getting into the market? The agent’s valuation looks competitive and the house suits your criteria, wonder what it might go for? With this project I can open Power BI on my phone, select the suburb and see how the much the property around the corner sold for at auction two weeks ago. <p>
								<p>One would argue that using the Domain app is just as easy, and in some ways it is. The phone app in particular is great for seeing active listings, with its drop pin / map view. On the desktop site you can manually scroll back through auction results as well as explore some demographic data from the 2016 Census. The caveat to this is that it is paginated, and time quickly adds up clicking through each page (you could theoretically click your way back to the first property sold in a suburb through Domain). The power in creating your own database comes from the ability to filter data in more advanced methods. I can see auction results for any given period, median sale price at a particular year, number of properties sold in 2013 and so on. </p>
								<p>To pull the data, I had different approaches for each dataset. Since the ABS Census information is static and only released each year, it was simple enough to download the excel files, python script them into an attribute table for filtering purposes and then throw it all into a MySQL database. The Domain data on the other hand is a more complicated beast as it’s constantly updated. Domain have APIs that allow you to access their database without having to navigate the front-end service, meaning raw data can pulled down and filtered. For this, I have a set of scripts that run weekly/fortnightly/quarterly as the data is released. Using Task Scheduler, it’s possible to cue them so they run automatically without much upkeep too! </p>
								<p>MySQL feeds directly into Power BI, and with some playing around I’ve managed to get some dashboards together featuring important information that I am interested in.<i> Disclaimer: If it’s not already obvious it will be after reading this post, please do your own research and decide for yourself as to what information or data is useful to your circumstances when choosing a new property.</i></p>
								<h3>Suburb View</h3>
								<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
									<img src="images/suburbview.png" style="max-width: 100%;" class="center"/>
								  </div>
								</p>This is the page for each suburb, it allows me to see specific data in that area. The values on the right are latest for both units and houses, which can be flipped between (in this case its houses). It’s a separate API request for each type of property, land being another option. </p>
								<p>As for the line graphs, median sold price and annual rent income are two of about twenty available categories (25th percentile, 75th percentile, clearance rate, number of sales, etc.), one could argue that capital gain is the most important factor in an investment property, and annual rent an indicator of annual return. These can be flicked to other values rather easily, however, to prevent clutter I have left them out. If I choose to dig deeper into a suburb, I might pull them out and have a look. </p>  
								<p>The auction results API is neat in that it spits out a longitude and latitude of each property, so its easily displayed through a map plugin. Overall, this is the page I spend most of my time on. </p>
								<h3>Demographics</h3>
								<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
									<img src="images/demogview.png" style="max-width:100%;" />
								  </div>
								</p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics have some good data which has been packaged and made available online. It will require some organization and manipulation to make it easy to view by suburb, but if you only have one or two suburbs in mind it can be navigated with some brute force. I can bring up any dataset, select every suburb in Victoria and it will rank them based on that field. For example, if I were to sort by population density, I can immediately see which suburbs have the most people:</p>
								<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
									<img src="images/density.png" style="max-width:75%;" />
								  </div>
								</P>In summary, if you slide a lackluster episode into a regular season your fans will turn a blind eye. Deny them a well written finale or replace their favorite characters and they will gather with pitchforks.
